# Self Study MIT 6.S081 Operating System Engineering Year 2020

## Overview
This repository contain my self study and work related to MIT 6.S081 Operating System
Engineering in Year 2020.  I am self study the course to improve my operating
system knowledge.  The repository contain my laboratory solution in conceptual
terms.  No actual code is provided.  Instead I provide my approach to the lab
problems.

## Laboratory Work
### Lab 1 Utilities
This lab introduces idea of pipe and fork.  The problems are related to using
pipe and fork to create concurrent programs with multiple processes which
communicate with each other.  For lab problem of primes using sieving method,
recursion is used to create child process and pipe is used to connect child and
parent processes.

Lab 1 instruction and solutions are available at
Lab 1 instruction is "1 Lab Xv6 and Unix
utilities.pdf" (at repository root directory)
and relevent material "Bell Labs and CSP Threads.pdf"
(also at repository root directory).
